# Clash-tutorial-for-Olares

This repository is a tutorial that shares how to configure Clash for the Olares system.

# Installing Clash

First, we need to install Clash on the device. Since we want to enable TUN mode, we will choose clash-premium.
Use the [clash-premium-installer](https://github.com/Kr328/clash-premium-installer), which is an installer for clash-premium. This installer also requires clash-core to function, and you can use the backup repository [Kuingsmile/clash-core]((https://github.com/Kuingsmile/clash-core)) (the original author of Clash has unfortunately left ãƒ½( àº¶â–® àº¶)ï¾‰!!!).


## Installation Points

- Make sure to choose the premium version of clash-core, premium version, premium version (important things should be repeated three times).

- After extracting clash-core, copy it to /usr/bin/clash. Some tutorials may suggest using /usr/local/bin/clash, but if you use that directory, you might encounter issues finding clash in subsequent operations, which would require changing environment variables and startup configurationsâ€”too troublesome. Itâ€™s better to just use /usr/bin/clash.

- The default path for the configuration file is /srv/clash/config.yaml.

- The Country.mmdb file will be automatically downloaded when Clash starts, but it may not download successfully (you know the reason; otherwise, why would you need a VPN? Sigh, what a strange dependencyâ€”starting a VPN requires having a working VPN ãƒ½( àº¶â–® àº¶)ï¾‰!!!). In such cases, youâ€™ll need to manually download Country.mmdb and copy it to the corresponding directory. You can find the download link in the logs after Clash starts, and the storage directory can also be found in the logs. If you canâ€™t find it, the default paths are `~/.config/clash/Country.mmdb` or `/root/.config/clash/Country.mmdb`.
- Enabling TUN mode may require configuring the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` file, which should look something like this ðŸ‘‡
    ```
    DNS=127.0.0.1 
    FallbackDNS=114.114.114.114 
    DNSStubListener=no
    ```
